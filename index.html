    <b><h2>Abstract</h2></b>
    <p>Currently there are no affordable devices that allow people to detect real-time chemical or physiological changes in their breath after consuming medication.
      Current technology is too expensive and there is no easy way to see those effects happening in real time, however using my invention we can find changes in breath VOC 
      that can signal multiple distress warnings. The device works by analyzing the personâ€™s breath and biometric signals after they consume a medication, and then using a vast
      amount of sensors, the smart breathalyzer can detect numerous health conditions via exhaled breath such as fever, inflammation, shallow breathing, dehydration, respiratory
      issues, and sedative side effects. The Arduino then collects and processes these signals in real time, and when it detects a change it displays the feedback on the OLED 
      screen. By combining breath analysis with biometric sensing, my project is a low-cost solution for early detection of drug reactions, stimulant effects, and metabolic changes
      helping people to make better and safer health decisions. This technology could revolutionize the medical world by making real-time health monitoring accessible to anyone 
      without the need for expensive clinical equipment.</p>
