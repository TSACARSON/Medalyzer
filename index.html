    <b><h2>Abstract</h2></b>
    <p>Currently there are no affordable devices that allow people to detect real-time chemical or physiological changes in their breath after consuming medication.
      Current technology is too expensive and there is no easy way to see those effects happening in real time, however using my invention we can find changes in breath VOC 
      that can signal multiple distress warnings. The device works by analyzing the person’s breath and biometric signals after they consume a medication, and then using a vast
      amount of sensors, the smart breathalyzer can detect numerous health conditions via exhaled breath such as fever, inflammation, shallow breathing, dehydration, respiratory
      issues, and sedative side effects. The Arduino then collects and processes these signals in real time, and when it detects a change it displays the feedback on the OLED 
      screen. By combining breath analysis with biometric sensing, my project is a low-cost solution for early detection of drug reactions, stimulant effects, and metabolic changes
      helping people to make better and safer health decisions. This technology could revolutionize the medical world by making real-time health monitoring accessible to anyone 
      without the need for expensive clinical equipment.</p>

      <h2  class="box">Problem</h2>
      <p></p>Drugs and stimulants like caffeine, opioids, and over-the-counter medications can cause subtle yet measurable physiological changes  
      like altered breath composition, body temperature shifts, drowsiness, or agitation.Currently, no affordable consumer-level device offers 
      non-invasive symptom detection in real time.

      <h2>Background info:</h2>
      <p>: I first want to make a handheld breathalyzer with a 3d printed nozzle to blow in. The breathalyzer will consist of a MQ-135 sensor VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) sensor
        and it will detect the presence of changes in breath composition. After noticing a change in VOC level it will display the units in either ppm or µg/m³ on the OLED display.
        To experiment I will first record the baseline after breathing normally and then test again 5–10 minutes after drinking soda or caffeine. I will then log how much the reading
        jumps. That is the basic model and the biometric analysis will help by going beyond “what's in the breath” but also how the body is reacting.
